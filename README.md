### About the data

This dataset is sample data from [IBM's Watson Analytics](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/sales-win-loss-sample-dataset/). The data is from a CRM system that has been run through a process to make it somewhat model ready for analysis. The purpose of the data is to discover patterns with sales wins and losses. This could allow a Sales Operations team to communicate to executive leadership what factors contribute to winning and losing. That allows the orgainization to be proactive and possibly change the outcome.
